Training is the key element for the professionalism of any
 Army. The Nepalese Army is no exception. The Nepalese Army
  has always given utmost priority to provide its personnel 
  with adequate trainings. In accordance with the famous saying
   of King Prithivi Narayan Shah, the Great, "The abilities of
    the Soldiers needs to be polished at all times", the 
    Nepalese Army has always emphasized and provided 
    professional trainings to its Soldiers and Officers alike
     to keep the Nepalese Army ever ready to meet the challenges
      that they may have to face. The Nepalese Army also
       provides with specialist and vocational trainings to its
        troops. The Nepalese Army institutionalized modern 
        training with the establishment of the Nepalese Army 
        School in Chhauni in 1953. Today, the NA has many
         specialized army-level academies and schools under
          the Directorate General of Military Training (DGMT).
