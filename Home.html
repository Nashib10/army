    <p> The armed forces used to be centrally located during the ancient times, whereas, in the middle age,
        they were deployed in vital locations like fortresses in strategically important places of the country.
         The commander of the fortress was called "Kwantha Nayak" and they were very powerful. The Malla dynasties
          ruled Nepal in the middle age. Newar 
       Malla kings ruled over Kathmandu valley and the surrounding areas while the Karnali region was ruled by Khas
        Malla kings, who had maintained powerful armies. King Jitari Malla had attacked Kathmandu valley but the Khas
         Malla forces were ignobly defeated by the Newari Malla soldiers.

       During this period, Nepal was divided into fifty different principalities which meant that military strength 
       remained dispersed. Soldiers were maintained by the kings, princes, chiefs of army, mulmi, kwantha nayaks and
        umraos. These traditional ranks were prestigious positions in the army. Since some of the principalities were stronger than the others, there were continuous clashes. In Kathmandu valley, and also in Doti, it is now known that Indian mercenaries had also been used. The significance of military might derived from the Pauranic Age was well understood and used liberally.
       
       The 1700s was a century of uncertainty throughout the world. Rivalry among states was not confined to this part 
       of the planet. The world military powers like Britain, France and Portugal were busy creating colonies in 
       different parts. Clashes in their interests resulted in wars in different countries. Britain and France were
        also moving towards South and Southeast Asia. This threatened Nepal as well.</p>

            Their gallantry, sincerity and simplicity impressed even the enemy, so much so, that the British East-
            India Company started recruiting Nepalese into their forces. Since the British had fought against the 
            Nepali Army, which was till that time, still colloquially known as "Army of Gorkha" or "Gorkhali" army,
             the British took to calling their new soldiers "Gurkhas". Hence, in essence, the “Gorkha” heritage belongs,
              first and foremost, to the Nepali Army.
   
   There is still some misunderstanding that the Nepali Army is a part of the British and Indian Armies. The Gurkha Rifles existing in India and Britain are part of foreign military organizations where Nepalese are recruited. The NA rightfully is the proud national army of sovereign and independent Nepal with an unbroken history since the year 1744. The fact that Nepal and the Nepalese people have never been subjugated by any colonial power is a significant achievement 
   of the Nepali Army. King Prithvi Narayan Shah the Great was the founder of the Nepali Army.</p>
